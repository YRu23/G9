- **End-to-End Testing**: Simulate user scenarios to make sure that the entire system workflow from beginning to end. This helps to identify potential issues that might be missed in unit or integration testing. Ensure that the application works together to deliver the expected outcome.

## Performance Tests

- **Load Testing**: Simulate the expected number of users accessing the system simultaneously. This helps in understanding the limits that the system can handle under typical usage scenarios and ensures it performs smoothly.
