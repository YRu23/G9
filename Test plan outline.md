Test plan:
The purpose of the test is to ensure that the movie rating application meets both functional requirements and performance expectations, providing users with a high-quality and reliable and user friendly experience. The main areas that will be tested are movie search functionality, movie rating features for users, and API performance and reliability.

Functional tests:
•	Integration tests to ensure that all components work well together seamlessly. This is important and helps in detecting interface defects and issues that arise when combining different parts of system, in this project is the third party integration like IMDb API.
•	End to end testing, by simulating the user scenarios to make sure that the entire system workflow from begin till end. This helps to identify potential issues that might be missed in unit or integration testing. Make sure that the application work together to deliver the expected outcome. 
Performance test:
•	Load testing, simulate the expected number of user that might accessing the system simultaneously. This helps in understanding the limits that the system can handle under typical usage scenarios and to perform smoothly.
